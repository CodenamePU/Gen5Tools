**Very experimental. The struct is not completely figured out (help on this would be appreciated), and it is not dynamic in terms of sizing (you will have to state a fixed size every time). You have been warned.**

* Extract the overworld NARC a1/2/6.
* Feed the script one of the files: 
  ```python CheapFurniture.py decompile 126_xxx.bin```
* Make your changes.
* Recompile (**Make sure you have the b2w2.s in the same directory.**):
  ```python CheapFurniture.pycompile 126_xxx.s``` 
* Reinsert to NARC, reinsert NARC into ROM.
* Profit!
